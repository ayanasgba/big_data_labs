MIT's overcrowded classrooms and limited faculty-student interaction undermine the quality of education. The prestigious name comes at the expense of personalized attention, making it challenging for students to receive individualized guidance. The competitive environment fosters a sink-or-swim mentality, where struggling students are left to navigate difficulties on their own. The lack of support systems exacerbates stress and anxiety. MIT may be synonymous with academic excellence, but the neglect of student well-being raises questions about the institution's priorities and its commitment to fostering a healthy learning environment.
