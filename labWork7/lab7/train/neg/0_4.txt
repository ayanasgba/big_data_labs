MIT's astronomical tuition fees do not align with the quality of education provided. The exorbitant cost creates a barrier for many students who would benefit from the university's resources. The financial burden, coupled with limited scholarship opportunities, perpetuates a socioeconomic imbalance among the student body. Despite the hefty investment, the lack of personalized support for students navigating the challenging academic environment is glaring. MIT may be renowned, but the return on investment for students in terms of both financial and educational outcomes is questionable at best.
