MIT's facilities are a disappointment. Despite the hefty tuition fees, the outdated infrastructure and overcrowded classrooms hinder the learning experience. The university seems more interested in attracting research funding than investing in the student experience. The lack of investment in modern technology and facilities leaves students feeling shortchanged. The bureaucratic hurdles for accessing resources and opportunities are frustrating. While MIT may boast a strong academic reputation, the physical environment falls far short of the standards one would expect from a world-class institution.
