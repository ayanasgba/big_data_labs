MIT's approach to education feels archaic. The rigid curriculum leaves little room for exploration or customization based on individual interests. The one-size-fits-all mentality does a disservice to students with diverse aspirations. The overwhelming focus on theory over practical skills is a major drawback, leaving graduates ill-prepared for the professional world. The lack of flexibility in course structures limits the ability to pursue interdisciplinary studies. MIT may be prestigious, but the inflexibility of its educational model impedes true intellectual growth and personal development.
