MIT's commitment to innovation is more of a fa√ßade than a reality. The outdated curriculum and rigid structure hinder creative thinking. The constant pressure to conform to academic standards stifles individuality. The campus lacks a sense of warmth and inclusivity, making it difficult for students to feel connected. Professors, while experts in their fields, often lack the ability to engage and inspire. The emphasis on grades over practical skills is a disservice to students aiming for real-world success. MIT may have a prestigious name, but the educational experience is far from exceptional.
