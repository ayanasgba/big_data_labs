MIT prides itself on innovation, but in reality, it's an innovation graveyard. The bureaucratic hurdles and lack of resources for student projects stifle creativity. The outdated facilities and technology make it feel like a university stuck in the past. Professors, while renowned in their fields, often lack the communication skills to effectively convey complex ideas. The high tuition fees are unjustifiable given the limited access to resources and opportunities. MIT might be a name, but the quality of education and overall experience leave much to be desired.
