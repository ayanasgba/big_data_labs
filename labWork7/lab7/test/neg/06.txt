MIT's elitist culture creates a hostile environment for those who don't fit the mold. The emphasis on competition over collaboration fosters a toxic atmosphere where students are more concerned with outperforming each other than learning together. The campus lacks a sense of inclusivity, making it challenging for individuals from diverse backgrounds to feel welcome. The administration's indifference to addressing these issues perpetuates a culture of exclusivity. MIT may be a hub for technological advancement, but its failure to prioritize a supportive community undermines the overall educational experience.
