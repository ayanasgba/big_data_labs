My experience at MIT has been nothing short of disappointing. The overwhelming workload and intense competition create a toxic atmosphere. Professors seem more focused on their research than teaching, leaving students struggling to grasp complex concepts without proper guidance. The campus lacks a sense of community, making it difficult to find support among peers. The emphasis on theoretical knowledge often feels disconnected from real-world applications, leaving graduates unprepared for practical challenges. MIT may be prestigious, but the toll it takes on mental well-being and overall satisfaction is hardly worth it.
