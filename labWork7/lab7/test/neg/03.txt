MIT's reputation is overrated. The pressure to succeed academically is suffocating, and the competitive environment fosters a cutthroat mentality among students. The focus on theoretical knowledge overshadows practical skills, leaving graduates ill-equipped for the real world. The lack of diversity and inclusivity creates a homogeneous culture that stifles creativity. The administration is unresponsive to student concerns, and the overall campus experience is isolating. MIT may be a powerhouse in research, but as an educational institution, it falls short of providing a nurturing and supportive environment.
