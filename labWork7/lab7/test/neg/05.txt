MIT's reputation as a technological powerhouse is overshadowed by its lackluster teaching environment. The professors, while accomplished, often fail to communicate effectively, leaving students to decipher complex concepts on their own. The competitive atmosphere discourages collaboration, hindering the learning experience. The focus on research means that classroom education takes a back seat. The exorbitant tuition fees are not justified by the limited resources available to students. MIT may be renowned, but the overall experience leaves much to be desired for those seeking a well-rounded education.
